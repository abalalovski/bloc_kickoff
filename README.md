## Description

This is a bootstrap for Flutter Bloc projects. It sets up basic Flutter project enabled with flutter_bloc, rxdart, local notifications, etc. It's an ongoing effort to keep it up to date so it's constantly evolving.

## Structure

The imagined feature is declared in a package `feature` that has the implementation for the feature's Bloc, and everything that goes along. So, its state, events and view model. At this point the kickoff does not contain tests - yet to come.
